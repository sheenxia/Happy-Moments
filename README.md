### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: The Happy Moments of Males
+ This project is conducted by XIN XIA (xx2295)

+ Project summary: [a short summary] The project mainly focuses on the sentiment analysis of males' happy moments. I first find out what are those important sentiments coming from males' happy moments. Then I look deep into males' joy sentiment and further split them into two groups single and married status to see if there's a big difference. I also find out where are these males' words coming from and which country contributes most to the happy moments. Finally, I pick out two countries Venezuela and United Kingdom to see their joy sentiment words.
