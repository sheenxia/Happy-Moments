###What are those sentiments from males?

```{r   , message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# male's sentiment 
df_male %>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)%>%
  anti_join(my_stop_words) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))%>%
  group_by(sentiment)%>% count(word)%>% summarize(Score = sum(n))%>%arrange(desc(Score))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(sentiment,-Score), y = Score))+
  geom_bar(aes(fill=sentiment),stat = "identity")+
  xlab("sentiment") + ylab("Score") + ggtitle("sentiment of males")


```

Looking at the sentiment from male's happy moments, we can find that positive, joy,trust,and anticipation contribute most of the sentiments. For the rest of the sentiments such as negative, sadness , fear , anger ,and disgust, they don't play a big part in male's happy moments.So what are those words contributing to the joy sentiment?



###The most common joy words from males.
```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# explore male's joy sentiment
  df_male %>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)%>%
  anti_join(my_stop_words) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("joy"))%>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ####plot most common joy words of males
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE,fill = "orange") +
  labs(y = "Contribution to sentiment",
       x = NULL)+coord_flip()

```

From the plot, We can see that friend is the most frequent word. Birthday is the second. Also, Males really enjoy talking about thier family especially their daughter and mother. Of course, males are happy with money,food,shopping and vacation.

##Single vs Married

###Wordcloud 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.height=6, fig.width=6,echo=FALSE}
#split males into single and married
male_single <- df_male%>%filter(marital =="single")
male_married<- df_male%>%filter(marital =="married")

#wordcloud
corpus<-Corpus(VectorSource(male_single$text))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, stripWhitespace)
tdm.all<-TermDocumentMatrix(corpus)
tdm.tidy=tidy(tdm.all)
tdm.overall=summarise(group_by(tdm.tidy, term), sum(count))

corpus1<-Corpus(VectorSource(male_married$text))
corpus1 <- tm_map(corpus1, stripWhitespace)
tdm.all1<-TermDocumentMatrix(corpus1)
tdm.tidy1=tidy(tdm.all1)
tdm.overall1=summarise(group_by(tdm.tidy1, term), sum(count))


par(mfrow=c(2,1), las=1, mar=c(3.1, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
###male married word cloud

wordcloud(tdm.overall1$term, tdm.overall1$`sum(count)`,
          scale=c(3,0.5),
          max.words=20,
          min.freq=1,
          random.order=FALSE,
          rot.per=0.3,
          use.r.layout=T,
          random.color=FALSE,
          colors=brewer.pal(7,"Greens"))

###male single word cloud
wordcloud(tdm.overall$term, tdm.overall$`sum(count)`,
          scale=c(3,0.5),
          max.words=20,
          min.freq=1,
          random.order=FALSE,
          rot.per=0.3,
          use.r.layout=T,
          random.color=FALSE,
          colors=brewer.pal(9,"Blues"))


```

Comparing with the two word clouds,the top one is from married males and it's clear that married males talk about thier wife most of time and they focus more on thier family members such as son and daughter. The bottom is from single males and we find that they care more about their friends most of time. Besides, single males talk more about girlfriend.

### Big difference in joy sentiment?

```{r ,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
word <- c("happy","ago","yesterday","lot","today","months","month",
                 "happier","happiest","last","week","past","finally","found","favorite","received","happiness","excited","surprise","beautiful","fun","delicious","celebrated","pay","expected","prepared","share","friend","money","unexpected","love","food","green","birthday","score","mother","shopping","smile","gift","pretty","vacation","laugh","special","joy","perfect","wonderful","pleasant","bonus","graduation"
)

sm_stop_words <- stop_words %>%
  bind_rows(mutate(tibble(word), lexicon = "updated"))



require(gridExtra) # For combining two plots
####married male joy
plot1<- male_married%>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)%>%
  anti_join(sm_stop_words) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("joy"))%>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ####plot most common joy words of married males
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE,fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(y = "Contribution to sentiment",
       x = NULL, title="Married")+ 
  coord_flip()

####single male joy
plot2 <- male_single%>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)%>%
  anti_join(sm_stop_words) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("joy"))%>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
    ####plot most common joy words of single males
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE,fill = "lightgoldenrod1") +
  labs(y = "Contribution to sentiment",
       x = NULL, title="Single")+
  coord_flip()

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)

```

In order to have a clear comparison, I removed the same common words such as "friend","money","love","food" and "birthday". Then we can find that married males have happy moments when they spend time with their family and they care more about thier children and marriage. On the other hand, the single males enjoy music, cream, and beer.

###Which country contributes most of words?
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# countries contributing most words
 df_male%>%unnest_tokens(word,cleaned_hm)%>%group_by(country)%>%count(word)%>%summarise(total_words = sum(n))%>%arrange(desc(total_words))%>%top_n(5)%>%ungroup()%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(country,total_words) , y = total_words))+
  geom_bar(aes(fill=country),stat = "identity")+
  xlab("country") + ylab("words") + ggtitle("words contributed from countries")

```

As shown above, most of male words are from America and India. So we can think that the sentiment mainly focus on American and Indian males.

###The joy sentiment comparison between American and Indian males.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#remove extra stopwords
word <- c("happy","ago","yesterday","lot","today","months","month",
                 "happier","happiest","last","week","past","finally","found","favorite","received","happiness","excited","surprise","beautiful","fun","delicious","celebrated","pay","expected","unexpected","prepared","share","friend","unexpected","love","green","birthday","score","mother","wonderful","smile","gift","pretty","outstanding","money","daughter")



new_stop_words <- stop_words %>%
  bind_rows(mutate(tibble(word), lexicon = "updated"))


###USA anticipation sentient
require(gridExtra) # For combining two plots

###VEN anticipation sentient

p1<-df_male%>%
  filter( country == "VEN")%>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)%>%
  anti_join(new_stop_words) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("joy"))%>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE,fill = "red") +
  labs(y = "Contribution to sentiment",
       x = NULL, title="Venezuela")+
  coord_flip()

###GBR anticipation sentient

p2<-df_male%>%
  filter( country == "GBR")%>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)%>%
  anti_join(new_stop_words) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("joy"))%>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE,fill = "royalblue") +
  labs(y = "Contribution to sentiment",
       x = NULL, title="United Kingdom")+
  coord_flip()


grid.arrange(p1, p2,ncol=2)

```

From the plot, it's interesting that males of Venezuela are happy about food especially they love chocolate and they also love dancing. While British males really love association football and they enjoy music as well.
